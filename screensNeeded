Do we need separate accounts? 
Should we have USER, EMPLOYEE, and ADMIN accounts? 
Should we just assume EMPLOYEE should have ADMIN rights?

New membership (USER or EMPLOYEE): (ask for clarification)
	- Create account
	- Choose length of membership
	- List all members that will be able to use the account
	
Movie listings page (USER):
	- Whaaaaaaaat. Need to ask for wording clarification
	- Select a complex, list all movie showings currently scheduled for that complex? 
	- If so, populate table with movie name, theater, and show time data
	- Also, user can request listing that includes all complexes. If so, populate a table for EACH complex,
		listing the complex's name and address before the listings.

Seat reservation (USER):
	- Members will be able to see a seating chart and reserve seats. Chart will show reserved and open seats. 
		Members can reserve any seats they wish. However, the total number of seats reserved using an account
		must not exceed the number of members associated with the account. 
		EG. An account of 5 members cannot reserve more than 5 seats for a movie.
		
Movie viewing history (USER):
	- Select member or account. For either member or account number, show a list of the movies they have seen. 
		For account, list the movies seen by each member associated with the account. The account history will be in alphabetical
		order by movie title within member (in alphabetical order)

Schedule movies (EMPLOYEE):
	- Add movie listings
	- EMPLOYEE will assign a movie to a theater within a complex at a certain time. Scheduling 2 movies at the same start
		time (within 30 minutes) in the same theater is not allowed. Run time doesn't matter.
